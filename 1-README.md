# electric-potential
This repository explores an apparent inconsistency in physics—why electric potential is set to zero at infinity in electrostatics but at Earth in circuit analysis—and shows how different reference points reflect the flexibility of mathematical models based on context.


# About Me:-
I'm Sharmin Nabab.
I'm currently a high school student.
My interests span mathematics and physics. I also enjoy coding and am currently learning Python.
I like to break down concepts and rebuild ideas as if explaining to my younger self, often through a first-principles approach.
This space serves as a notebook for my reconstructions and explorations of ideas.
