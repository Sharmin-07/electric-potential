Long Version- 

Electric potential at a point can be defined in two equivalent ways: as the negative of the work done by the electrostatic force in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to that point, or as the work done by an external agent in moving a unit positive charge from that point to infinity quasi-statically. Let’s proceed with the former definition.
Consider a point charge q. To find the electric potential at a point in space, at position $vec{r}$ in space with respect to q, imagine bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to this point. In case of a unit positive charge, the force vector $vec{F}$ is equal to the electric field $vec{E}$ . Since work is defined as the dot product of force and displacement, and the distance between the source charge and the test charge keeps changing as the charge moves inward, this work has to be calculated using an integral. 
$$
W = -\int_{\infty}^{r} \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r}
